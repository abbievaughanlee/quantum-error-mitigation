# Background
Quantum computers are powerful but fundamentally noisy, which corrupts the results of quantum algorithms. The goal of this project is to solve that problem by using machine learning to "denoise" the output. By training a neural network on thousands of simulated quantum circuits, the model will learn to predict the ideal, error-free results from the noisy data that a real quantum computer would produce. This serves as a practical error mitigation technique to make current quantum hardware more reliable.
